# 🛡️ Social Engineering Simulation Project
### Internship Project at InLighnX Global

---

## 📘 Overview
This internship project tests cybersecurity awareness through a **social engineering (phishing) simulation**.  
A harmless phishing-style email was sent to pre-informed participants and feedback was collected to measure detection, behaviour, and learning.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Execute an ethical phishing-style awareness simulation.  
- Measure participant reactions and identify common red flags.  
- Analyze feedback to produce recommendations for improved security awareness.

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- **Google Forms** — feedback collection  
- **Google Sites** — safe landing page for the simulation  
- **Mailmeteor** — email distribution (campaign)  
- **Google Sheets / Excel** — data handling and basic analysis  
- **MS Word / PowerPoint / Canva** — report and slides design  
- **GitHub** — project hosting and documentation

## 🧪 Methodology (summary)
1. Created a professional-tone, harmless phishing-style email.  
2. Hosted a safe landing page explaining the simulation.  
3. Pre-notified participants ethically about the upcoming simulation.  
4. Sent emails to 16 participants and collected responses with Google Forms.  
5. Analyzed responses and prepared findings, visualizations, and recommendations.

## 📊 Key Results (summary)
- **Participants:** 16  
- **Most common red flags noticed:** unusual sender address, urgency tone, suspicious link  
- **% who checked sender/link before clicking:** ~69%  
- **Average realism / effectiveness:** High (majority rated simulation effective)  
- **Outcome:** Participants reported increased awareness and intended behavior changes (e.g., verify sender, avoid clicking suspicious links).

## 🔍 Findings & Recommendations (short)
- Regular, realistic simulations help build awareness.  
- Train users to verify sender addresses, hover links, and pause before clicking.  
- Provide short follow-up tips when participants click suspicious links.
