## 📘 Project Overview

This project aims to analyze **cybersecurity awareness** among users through a **Social Engineering Simulation**.  
The simulation involved sending a realistic but **harmless phishing-style email** to pre-informed participants and analyzing their responses.  

The goal was to evaluate how effectively individuals recognize suspicious communication patterns and to promote awareness against phishing attacks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To ethically simulate a phishing-style email scenario.  
- To test user awareness and behavioral response.  
- To identify common red flags noticed by participants.  
- To recommend strategies to improve cybersecurity training.

## 🧠 Methodology

1. Designed a phishing-style awareness email with a professional tone.  
2. Created a harmless landing page using Google Sites.  
3. Pre-informed participants about the ethical nature of the simulation.  
4. Distributed emails via Mailmeteor to 16 participants.  
5. Collected behavioral feedback through a Google Form.  
6. Analyzed responses for awareness level, realism rating, and red flag detection.

## 📊 Results Summary

- **Total Participants:** 16  
- **70%** verified the sender’s identity before clicking.  
- **25%** clicked the link without verifying.  
- **Most Common Red Flags Noticed:** Fake sender name, urgency tone, suspicious link.  
- **Average Realism Rating:** 4.1 / 5  
- **Overall Awareness Level:** High

## 💡 Key Findings

- Most participants were aware of phishing indicators.  
- Urgent tone and fear-based messaging still influenced some users.  
- Ethical phishing simulations are effective in reinforcing awareness.

---

## 🛠️ Recommendations

- Conduct periodic social engineering simulations.  
- Include phishing awareness in digital literacy training.  
- Encourage users to “Think Before You Click.”  
- Use visual cues and reminders in organizations to reinforce caution.
